<h3 style="margin-left: 11px;"> The idea behind  <em> Zomato</em> – A brief history </h3>



<br>

  <p id="p2" style= "font-weight:6 ;background-color: white ;margin-left: 45px;"> The idea of an online food menu struck the duo when they saw people standing in a queue at lunchtime in the office and waiting for their chance to order. So they took pictures of the food court menu and uploaded them on their company’s private network. Everybody at the company started using the website, and Deepinder and Pankaj noted the huge traffic the network got in a few days’ time.
This gave them the idea of starting portal called “Foodiebay”, where users could browse through the menu of eating joints and restaurants and see their reviews and ratings right from their computer.<br> Foodiebay began listing restaurants from Delhi-NCR on their website and quickly expanded to other cities like Mumbai and Kolkata. 
<br>
<p id="p3" style="font-weight:6;margin-left: 45px;margin-right: 130px;">The first professional restaurant that found its spot on Foodiebay was from Hauz
  Khas in Delhi .
Soon the website was covering a thousands of restaurants from metropolitan cities and the founders thought that they would rebrand it with an appealing name that would attract customers abroad too, if they expand to such a level.<br> <br>
On November 2010, Foodiebay changed its name to Zomato. The reason behind changing its name was to extend it beyond the food sector and also to avoid possible confusion with the brand “ebay”, which sounds similar to “Foodiebay”.<br><br><b>As a result,
Foodiebay was rebranded as Zomato in November 2010 .</b>
 By 2016, Zomato had a full-fledged app up and running , which was providing food deliveries from registered restaurants, through their thousands of valets.

<hr>
<h3 style="margin-left:35px;"><em> Zomato's</em> Comparative Analysis </h3><br>


<p id="p6" style="font-weight: 6;" > In India, Zomato faces direct competition from rival Swiggy. Until 2020, it also had a strong competitor in the form of Uber Eats, which it acquired in a $206 million deal. Zomato enjoys a monopoly in the food delivery business in many smaller cities like Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula .<br><br>The online food aggregator made many enhancements to its delivery protocol during the unprecedented pandemic. Temperatures of all delivery valets were checked multiple times a day and they had to sanitize their hands before picking up any order.<br><br>
The company stopped accepting Cash on Delivery (COD) and encouraged people to use any kind of digital payment method. At the time of the delivery, the executive dropped customers’ packages outside their doors and left quickly to avoid the risk of transmitting or contracting the virus. Wearing a mask and a pair of gloves was, of course, mandatory for all valets. If they failed to do so, customers could report them through the delivery rating from the app. </p>

<br><br>
 <h3 style="margin-left:-12px;">Key Activities of <em> Zomato's</em> </h3><br>

</p>
<br>
<h3 style="margin-left:90px;">Top Reason's Behind<em> Zomato's</em> Success </h3><br>

<p id="p6" style="font-weight: 6;" > <b>1) First-mover advantage </b><br>
India wasn’t familiar with the terms “online food ordering” until Zomato came along. Thus, Zomato has always had the first-mover advantage to capitalize on. And it did so quite effectively too
 <br><br>
<b>2) Continuous flow of investment</b><br>
Zomato has never been shot of funds. If you take a close look at the funding timeline mentioned above in this blog post, you will see that Zomato has been very successful in convincing investors about its long-term vision and growth objectives.
 <br><br> 
<b>3) A strong network of restaurants and delivery valets</b><br>
Zomato has managed to bring most of the restaurants and hotels on its app, with much ease, despite the hefty commission and promotion fee that it charges. A handful of eating joints that are not listed on the platform are missing out on some really good revenue opportunities.
The online food ordering and delivery company also has a strong workforce of delivery agents. As a result, Zomato has provided employment to lakhs of youth in the country.
<br><br>
<b>4) Aggressive Marketing</b><br>
In today’s time of such intense competition, you have to put a lot of funds in taking the word out. Be it traditional marketing methods such as TV and newspapers, or the modern-day techniques involving search engines and social media, Zomato has left no stone unturned in making itself a household name.
<br><br>
<br><br>
<p id="p5" style="font-size: 45px;"><b><em>Conclusion</em> </b> </p>
<p id="p6" style="font-weight: 6;padding-right: 20px;" > By introducing the notion to provide access for
different restaurants and cafes, Zomato has entirely
revolutionized the functioning of the food and restaurant 
business. Zomato offers outlets according to the area, 
selection of kitchens, and customer budgets. It also provides 
consumers with an online supply service that ensures a seamless 
and an effective “ordering” process.<br><br>
 
Zomato also contributes by giving them advice as well as the ability to advertise its business by hooking images and posters in Zomato’s application, to improve the business model of various eateries, bistros, and cafés. In conjunction with several restaurants, Zomato organizes various events and festivals to create not only revenues for itself, but also for the businesses participating.
